Huge congratulations to Dr. Biswabhusan and our collaborators! Our latest collaborative research paper on voltage-gated ion transport in Ångström-scale confinement has been accepted for publication in Nature Communications.

This work presents a significant advancement in realizing voltage-gated ions transport through incredibly narrow (2.6 ~ 6 Ångström) channels, with the almost perfect cation selectivity evan at high concentration. We are thrilled to share this achievement and look forward to its publication.
